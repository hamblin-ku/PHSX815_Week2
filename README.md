## Homework 3
For Homework 3, I implemented a Rayleigh distribution into the Random Class.

## Homework 4
I ran CookieTimer.py with Nmeas = 50 and Nexp = 1000, and saved the output to the file 'cookie_output.txt'. I then plotted the distribution of all measurements, and then the experiment-averaged distribution.
